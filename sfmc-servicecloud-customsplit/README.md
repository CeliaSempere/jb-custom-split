# Salesforce Marketing Cloud - Service Cloud Custom Split Activity

## Introduction

This is a basic example of a custom journey builder split activity that reads data from Salesforce Service Cloud. As of April 2017 this is necessary as a workaround as decision split evaluation for changes in Service Cloud don't evaluate correctly if there are multiple instances of the queried object for one single contact (contact and object have a 1-many relationship) and even if there are multiple paths to one attribute in Contact Builder / Data Designer. I debugged and tested this issue together with a Sr. Technical Product Manager, Data Products of Salesforce Marketing Cloud, who confirmed that the team is working on a fix, where the desired path in contact model can be selected. However this fix won't be released before the end of the 2017. As mentioned in the marketing cloud documentation under [Create Custom Activities](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.mc-app-development.meta/mc-app-development/creating-activities.htm), it is possible to build custom splits, so I thought I'll just go ahead and give it a shot.

## Setup

1. Before this example can be used, a package containing a Journey Builder Activity needs to be created in [Salesforce Marketing Cloud App Center](https://appcenter-auth.s1.marketingcloudapps.com). A documentation for this task can be found here: [Create a Marketing Cloud App](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.mc-app-development.meta/mc-app-development/create-a-mc-app.htm).
	- __Important__: The activity's "Public Extension"-setting needs to be set to "This application and other installed Applications" and the example needs to be available via HTTPS which has to be running on the default port 443.
2. To secure the backend and make sure only requests from your marketing cloud instance are processed, you need to create a salt key in marketing cloud.
	- Information can be found in the documentation on [Key Management](http://help.marketingcloud.com/en/documentation/marketing_cloud/administration/keymanagement/) and [Encode with Customer Key](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.mc-app-development.meta/mc-app-development/encode-custom-activities-using-jwt-customer-key.htm). Follow these steps and add your salt key's ascii representation to backend/package.json under `options.salesforce.marketingCloud.jwtSecret`, as well as the external key seen in Key Management to all the `customerKey`-properties in public/config.json.
	- __Important__: According to the documentation the salt key can be converted by piping it to `xxd -p` and adding `0x` as prefix. However in my tests on MacOS and CentOS the last two characters `0a` had to be removed, so I propose to use `echo "Hello world" | xxd -p | sed 's/^/0x/;s/0a$//'` instead, where `Hello world` would be your salt.
3. The unique key of the created Journey Builder Activity needs to be added to public/config.json properties `key` and `configurationArguments.applicationExtensionKey`
4. Replace `<URL OF THE SERVER RUNNING THE BACKEND>` in public/config.json with the URL where your split's backend can be reached (needs to be proxied (e.g. using nginx) in case you use an unaltered version of backend/server.js).
5. Replace `<URL OF THE SERVER/CDN HOSTING THE PUBLIC FOLDER>` in public/config.json with the URL where the public folder of this example is hosted.
6. Adapt the `outcomes` of the split in public/config.json according to your needs.
7. Add your Service Cloud credentials to backend/package.json under `options.salesforce.serviceCloud.username` and `options.salesforce.serviceCloud.password`.
8. Adapt public/customActivity.js save-function so the desired Id from Service Cloud is passed in the inArguments. `<EVENT DATA ID PATH>` needs to be replaced with the field name of the entry event's data extension field containing the Id of the Service Cloud object to query. If your object is a custom Object named _CustomObject_ the path would be `CustomObject__c:Id` for example.
9. Adapt backed/lib/sfdc.js and backend/server.js so the desired object and field from Service Cloud is read and the outcome is returned accordingly.
10. Change the module name of the backend in backend/package.json
11. Before running the node/express server, you need to install the dependencies using the command `npm i` in the backend-folder.
12. _Optional_: Replace the icons for the custom activity in public/images.

## Usage

1. If the setup in App Center has been done correctly and the files are available under the specified endpoint you should be able to see the custom split when editing a journey in journey builder alsongside the other _Flow Control_ activities.
2. Drag the split to your journey and click on it to configure it.
	- In the only configuration step, provide the _Event Definition Key_ of the Service Cloud entry event, which can be found under _Journey Builder > Entry Sources_
3. Finish building your journey and activate it.
